#  Coupons Management API – Monk Commerce Backend Task

##  Overview

This project implements a RESTful API to manage and apply discount coupons for an e-commerce platform.

The system supports:

- Cart-wise coupons
- Product-wise coupons
- Buy X Get Y (BXGY) coupons
- Fetching applicable coupons
- Applying a specific coupon to a cart

The system is designed to be easily extensible for adding new coupon types in the future.

##  Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 In-Memory Database
- Maven

##  Architecture

Layered Architecture:

- **Controller Layer** – Handles API requests
- **Service Layer** – Contains business logic
- **Repository Layer** – Handles database access
- **DTO Layer** – Request/Response models

---

##  Implemented Coupon Types

### 1: Cart-wise Coupons

- Condition: Cart total exceeds a threshold
- Discount: Percentage applied to entire cart

**Example:**  
10% discount on cart total above 100

---

### 2: Product-wise Coupons

- Condition: Specific product exists in cart
- Discount: Percentage applied only to that product

**Example:**  
20% discount on Product ID 1

---

### 3: Buy X Get Y (BXGY)

- Condition: Buy X quantity of Product A
- Reward: Get Y quantity of Product B free
- Supports repetition logic
- Discount calculated based on free product price

**Example:**  
Buy 2 of Product 1 → Get 1 of Product 2 free

##  API Endpoints

### Coupon APIs

- `POST /coupons` → Create coupon  
- `GET /coupons` → Get all coupons  
- `GET /coupons/{id}` → Get coupon by ID  
- `PUT /coupons/{id}` → Update coupon  
- `DELETE /coupons/{id}` → Delete coupon  

---

### Applicable Coupons API

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /coupons/applicable`

**Returns:**
- All applicable coupons
- Calculated discount for each coupon

---

### Apply Coupon API

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /coupons/apply/{id}`

**Returns:**
- Cart items
- Total price
- Total discount
- Final price after applying coupon

---

##  Edge Cases Considered

- Null checks for coupon parameters
- Coupon not found handling
- No discount if conditions are not met
- Multiple coupons evaluated independently
- Zero quantity handling
- Invalid cart returns zero discount
- Safe BXGY calculation

---

##  Assumptions

- Only one coupon can be applied at a time
- Prices are always positive
- No tax calculations included
- Cart is passed in request body (not persisted)
- Coupon stacking is not supported
- No user authentication implemented

---

##  Unimplemented Cases (Due to Time Constraints)

- Category-based coupons
- Coupon stacking
- Maximum discount cap
- Expiration date validation
- User-specific coupons
- Coupon usage limits
- Inventory validation
- Multiple BXGY product arrays
- Concurrency handling
- Persistent database beyond in-memory

---

##  Future Improvements

- Implement Strategy Pattern for better extensibility
- Add global exception handling
- Add validation layer
- Add coupon expiration enforcement
- Add coupon priority rules
- Add unit tests
- Add caching (Redis)
- Persist cart data
- Add coupon usage tracking
